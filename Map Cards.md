#Map Cards
Map cards are used for two things in Darkest Night -- Blight creation and Search Results.  This section delves into the distributions of both on the cards.

##Search Results
Here is a table of search results per location.  The **bolded** numbers indicate the location you are most likely to achieve that result, and *italics* indicate locations that are a reasonable fit.  Numbers within parentheses indicate percentage chance of finding that result *at that location*, or in the total column, the overall distribution of that result *among all results anywhere*.
