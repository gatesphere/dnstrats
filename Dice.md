#Darkest Night's dice system
Darkest Night's primary dice mechanic is a dice pool system.  The target number fluctuates with the task at hand, and the pool size defaults to 1, but differs according to circumstance as well.

All things considered, Darkest Night's dice pool system is fairly kind to the player.  In most cases, you'll only need a single success to achieve your goal.  Additional successes often provide bonuses.  Occasionally the amount of failures you roll also factor into things, but it's not that common of an occurance.

This table lists the (rough) percentage chance of rolling *at least* one success:

      Target Number | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  | 6
 -------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|---
                1d6 | 100 | 83  | 67  | 50  | 33 | 17 
                2d6 | 100 | 97  | 89  | 75  | 56 | 31 
                3d6 | 100 | 100 | 96  | 88  | 70 | 42 
                4d6 | 100 | 100 | 99  | 94  | 80 | 52 
                5d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 97  | 87 | 60 
                6d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 98  | 91 | 67 
                7d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 99  | 94 | 72 
                8d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 96 | 77 
                9d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 97 | 81 
               10d6 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 98 | 84

Generally speaking, you should rarely worry about a target number of 3 or less, though they're not too terribly common in Darkest Night.  At a target number of 4, I would try to shoot for a 3 die pool to be relatively comfortable with the margin of error.  A 4-die pool is ideal for a target number of 5, and a target number of 6 you should ideally grow as large a pool as possible -- though not so much that you prevent yourself from fighting the Necromancer effectively.  Through most of the game, a 2-3 die pool will give you fairly decent results, but can be a bit swingy.

**TBD**: Probabilities for rolling at least N successes, etc.
